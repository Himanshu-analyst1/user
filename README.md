# 👤 User Management System (Frontend Project)

A responsive and interactive User Management System built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project allows users to log in, add profiles, search users, upload images, and manage their own data using browser localStorage.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Popup Login System
- 👥 Add User Profiles (Name, Bio, Image)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Users log in with a username.
- Every added profile stores the **owner's username**.
- Only:
  - The profile owner
  - Or the Admin  
  can delete that profile.
- Data is stored in browser localStorage.
- Demo profiles load automatically if storage is empty.
